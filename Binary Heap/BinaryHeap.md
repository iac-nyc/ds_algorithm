##  Binary Heap

✅Commonly applied in __priority queues__ due to its efficiency of quickly extracting the maximum or minimum values. It is also used by the famous ***heap sort*** algorithm.

☑️ Binary heap is a special binary tree with the following two properties:

<li>
It is a complete binary tree, meaning all levels of the tree have both left and right children(with the exception of the last-level leaves), and the last level has all the children as left as possible. This is known as <strong>shape property</strong>.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
A binary heap is either a min heap or a max heap. The min heap allows to quickly extract the minimum value of the tree, and the max heap allows to quickly extract the maximum value of the tree. All nodes are either greater than or equal to (<strong>max heap</strong>), or less than or equal to(<strong>min heap</strong>), each of its child nodes. This is known as <strong>heap property</strong>
</li>
