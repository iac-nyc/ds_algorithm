## Linked Lists Data Structure

✅Linked Lists store a sequential collection of elements but, unlike arrays, in linked lists the elements are not placed contiguously in memory.

Each element consists of a node that stores the element itself and also a reference(also known as a pointer or link) that points to the next element.

In __array__, we can directly access any element at any position; in the __linked lists__, if we want to access an element from the middle, we need to start from the beginning(__head__) and iterate the list until we find the desired element.  

####  ☑️Methods available for Linked Lists:

```
push(element):
This method adds a new element to the end of the list.
```
```
insert(element, position):
This method inserts a new element at a specified position in the list.
```
