##  Stack Data Structure

✅A ***stack*** is an ordered collection of items that follows the last in, first out (__LIFO__) principle. The addition of new items or the removal of existing items takes place at the same end. The end of stack is known as the top, and the opposite side is known as the base. The newest elements are near the top, and the oldest elements are near the base.

#### ☑️Methods available in the Stack class:


```
push(element(s))
This method adds a new element(or several elements) to the top of the Stack.
```
```
pop()
This method removes the top element from the Stack. It also returns the removed element.
```
```
peek()
This method returns the top element from the Stack. The Stack is not modified(it does not remove the element; it only returns the element for information purposes).
```
```
isEmpty()
This method returns 'true' if the Stack does not contain any elements, and 'false' if the size of the Stack is bigger than 0.
```
```
clear()
This method removes all the elements of the Stack.
```
```
size()
This method returns the number of elements that the Stack contains. It is similar to the length property of an array.
