##  Deque Data Structure
✅ The 'deque' data structure, also know as the double-ended queue, is a special
queue that allows us to insert and remove element from the end or from the front of the queue.

✅ A common application of a 'deque' is   ***storing a list of undo operations***. The deque implements both principles, __FIFO__ and __LIFO__, we can also say that the deque is a merger between the queue and the stack data structure.


## Methods:
__addFront(element)__:```This method adds a new element at the front of the deque```

__addBack(element)__:```This method adds a  new element at the back of the deque(same implementation as the enqueue method from the Queue class)```

__removeFront()__:```This method removes the first element from the deque(the same implementation as the dequeue method from the Queue class)```
