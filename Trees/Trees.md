## Trees

✅A non-sequential data structure. A tree is an abstract model of a hierarchical structure. The most common example of a tree in real life would be a family tree or a company organization chart.

☑️Terminology:

A tree consists of __nodes__ with a __parent-child__ relationship. Each node has a parent(except for the first node at the top) and zero or more children.


✔ Binary Tree:

A node in a __binary tree__ has two children at most: one left child and one right child. This definition allows us to write more efficient algorithms to insert, search, and delete nodes to/from a tree.
