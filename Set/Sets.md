## Sets Data Structure

✅A sequential data Structure that does not allow duplicated values.

A set is a collection of items that are unordered and consists of unique elements(meaning they cannot be repeated). This data structure uses the same mathematical concept as finite sets, but it is applied to a computer science data structure.


####  ☑️Methods available for a Set:

```
add(element):
This adds a new element to the set.
```
```
delete(element):
This removes the element from the set.
```
```
has(element):
This returns true if the element exists in the set and false otherwise.
```
```
clear():
This removes all the elements from the set.
```
```
size():
This returns how many elements the set contains.
It is similar to the length property of an array.
```
```
values():
This returns an array of all the values(elements) of the set.
```
